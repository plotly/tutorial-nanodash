# Nanodash: The World's Smallest Dashboarding Engine

A half-day tutorial in which learners build
a scale model of simple dashboarding engine like [Dash][dash]
in order to understand more about how the real thing works.

## Outline

Coming soon.

## Design

-   Three hours (i.e., half a day) because that's what most conferences prefer
    -   4-5 episodes of 30 minutes each
    -   Each episode is 10-15 minutes of code-along and 10-15 minutes of exercises and review
-   Assume Python competence (classes, decorators, basic [Flask][flask]) but minimal JavaScript
-   Do not use JavaScript frameworks: they hide too much and are more complex to debug (?)
-   No JavaScript build step: load required packages (e.g., [SVG.js][svgjs]) from the web (?)

## Try it out
To install requirements and run the sample `NanoDash` application:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sample.py
```
