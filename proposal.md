# Workshop Proposal

See <https://us.pycon.org/2025/speaking/tutorials/> for details.

## Title

Give your tutorial a name that accurately describes the tutorial's focus to potential students.

## Description

A high-level description of the tutorial, limited to ~300 characters. The description is used to describe your tutorial on the PyCon US website should it be selected. We ask that you make it brief.

## Audience

At what level of Python and other topic-specific experience or expertise is the tutorial aiming for?

The audience selections in the proposal submission form are as follows:

-   Just starting out: introductory, anyone can follow along without previous context
-   Some experience: some background knowledge/context is required
-   Advance experience: attendees must know the material to follow the session

These levels mean something different to everyone, however we ask that you select the most accurate audience level so attendees can decide if it is a good fit for them to attend. Feel free to include additional detail regarding the sort of background expected, as well as who may benefit. Reviewers need to know what level of Python experience is targeted and also what level(s) of domain-specific expertise is targeted, for example, networking, SQL, database, etc. See our sample tutorial proposals for details.

## Format

Please describe what portion of the tutorial you plan to spend on student exercises, lecture, or other activities. We don't want precision, we just want to know what teaching tools you'll use, and how interactive your tutorial will be. If you want to describe this via other means, feel free.

NOTE: In past years, we instead requested submitters categorize their tutorials as 'labs', 'workshops', or 'lectures', but found everyone's definition of those terms varied.

## Outline

Your outline should list the topics and activities you will guide your students through during your 3-hour tutorial. You may wish to consult the markdown guide for styling. Please err on the side of 'too much detail' rather than 'not enough'.

You should also include timing notes, estimating what portion of your tutorial you'll devote to each major topic (usually there are 2-5 of those).

The outline will not be shared with conference attendees.

*What should my timing notes look like? How precise do I need to be?*

We request you provide a rough estimate of how much time (or percentage of the talk) you'll dedicate to each major topic (not subtopics). We recommend these timings be no more precise than 30-minute increments, but we'll allow some leeway. Please don't give your timings down to the minute!

Alternatively, you are welcome to provide the portion of time you expect to spend on each major topic. Please indicate whether you are using percentages or minutes.

*Why an outline with timings?*

We want to assess what topics the tutorial will focus most on, as well as the level of students the course is appropriate for. For example, a course that spends 2.5 hours on simple concepts and ends with a brief tour of advanced features is more appropriate for a beginner audience than one with the opposite structure.

We hope these timings will help first-time tutorial presenters think about their material: can their planned material be realistically presented in the time allotted and in the depth they want?

We hope that these outline and timing notes will inform your decision on what is reasonable and inform us regarding what your tutorial will be like. It's fine if these timings change when you give the tutorial. We just want to see where the focus will be.

## Past Experience

Please summarize your teaching or public speaking experience, as well as your experience with the subject of the tutorial.

Tell us what experience you have in the subject, in activities such as teaching or public speaking, or anything else that would help us understand and gauge your abilities as a tutorial presenter. If possible, include a link to a video and slides from the tutorial itself (if it's been presented before), or of other material you have presented in the past.

This section will not be published on the PyCon US schedule. However, it is important, as we do give preference to those with speaking and teaching experience.

## Notes

This section is a place for submitters to communicate with the reviewers. You can use this space to describe anything you think might be relevant for us to help make you successful in your presentation. Additionally, you can include more materials related to your proposal that may help inform us about your topic.

## Requests/Accessibility

We will accommodate disability-related needs whenever reasonable, and the merit of your tutorial will be judged independently from any request made here. This section will not be visible to attendees.

## Known Conflicts

Please note that there may be Summits, such as the Education Summit, occurring on May 14th and 15th (conflicting with the tutorial days).
